# Node-classification-by-several-methods
In this repo, I have constituted 3 different methods to predict node labels in a graph-structured dataset, so called email dataset.

The dataset source: http://snap.stanford.edu/data

The knowledge source for GNN and GAT: https://github.com/deepmind/educational/blob/f44b133905a96e1887f5909aedcae6811b2c37a3/colabs/summer_schools/intro_to_graph_nets_tutorial_with_jraph.ipynb

For networkx documentation: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html

As of 2.11.2022, I have implemented the same apporach for another benchmark dataset called Cora dataset.
